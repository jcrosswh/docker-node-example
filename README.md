# Docker Node.js Example - A Sample API Application

## Introduction
Currently we are investigating having a slimmer middleware for our
applications since having a Java application server plus Spring plus
our environment causes issues.  One sample that we've decided to
investigate is using Node.js as the middleware since several companies
are moving in that direction.  This sample application is an attempt
to demonstrate how we could use Node.js to create middleware apps.  In
addition to this, we'd also like to investigate using Docker to ease
our deployment process.

## Features
- Implements a RESTful API
- Able to communicate with an Oracle DB
- Uses the [LoopBack](http://loopback.io) library for easy development
- Deployable using Docker

## Installation
### Running Locally
To obtain this application and run it locally, you must have Node.js
installed.  This application has been built and tested with Node v4.4.7,
but version 6 should work (just hasn't been tested.)  Once Node is
installed, run:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jcrosswhite-arrow/docker-node-example.git
$ cd docker-node-example
$ npm install
$ node .
```
This will start an Express server running locally on port 3000.  Browse
to [http://localhost:3000/explorer](http://localhost:3000/explorer) to
view the API endpoints.  All API endpoints are available under the /api/
endpoint.

### Building Using Docker
To build this application to run with Docker, first, have Docker
installed.  Next, build the application:
```bash
$ docker build -t my-dockerhub-username/docker-node-example .
```

Then, to run the application:
```bash
$ docker run -p <external port>:3000 my-dockerhub-username/docker-node-example
```
